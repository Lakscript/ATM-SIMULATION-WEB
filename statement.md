## Project Overview

This project is a *web-based ATM Simulator* built using *Python Flask* and *SQLite*.  
The system allows a user to:

- Create an account (with auto-generated Token & PIN)
- Login using Token + PIN
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money (with limit checks)
- View transaction history

The project demonstrates backend development, database integration, and a clean UI interface.

## My Contribution

### ✔ Backend (Fully Done by Me)
I wrote *100% of the backend logic*, including:

- Flask routing  
- Account generation logic  
- Deposit/withdraw functions  
- Balance validation  
- Database handling using SQLite  
- Transaction history storage  
- HTML templates & Jinja integration

### ✔ Database (Fully Done by Me)
- Designed the database schema  
- Created tables (accounts, history)  
- Wrote the initialization script (init_db.py)

### ✔ Frontend
- All *HTML and page logic* written by me  
- *CSS styling* was partially improved using basic suggestions from AI  
  (but all backend + functionality is coded by me)

## Learning Outcome
Through this project, I learned:

- Web backend development using Flask  
- Connecting Python with SQLite  
- Implementing authentication using Token + PIN  
- Creating and using virtual environments  
- Managing a project with Git & GitHub  
- Building a functional workflow for deposits/withdrawals/history  
- UI organization and styling concepts

## Final Notes
This is a fully working local Flask web application.  
It runs completely on the user’s system without requiring any external server.

The project represents my effort in understanding full-stack fundamentals with a strong focus on backend development.
